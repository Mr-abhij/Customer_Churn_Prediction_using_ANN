## 📊 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company.  
This project predicts **whether a customer is likely to leave the bank** based on key attributes such as:

- **Geography**

- **Age**
- **Credit Score**
- **Account Balance**
- **Tenure**
- **Number of Products**
- **Has Credit Card**
- **Is Active Member**
- **Estimated Salary**

The deployed app takes these inputs and outputs:
- ✅ **Churn Probability** (0.00–1.00)
- ✅ **Recommendation** (Likely to churn or not)
